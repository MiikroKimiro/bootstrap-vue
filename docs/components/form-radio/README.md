# Form Radio Input

> For cross browser consistency, `b-form-radio` uses Bottstrap's custom
radio input to replace the browser default radio input. It is built on top of
semantic and accessible markup, so it is a solid replacement for the default radio input.

### Options

Please see options in [`<b-form-select>`](./form-select) docs for details on passing options
to `b-form-radio`

### Control sizing
Set heights using thw `size` prop to `sm` or `lg` for small or large respectively.

### Non custom radio inputs
You can have `b-form-radio` render a browser native radio input by setting the `plain` prop.
